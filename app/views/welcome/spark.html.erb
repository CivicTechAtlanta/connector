    <p>Civic Spark Day is a day of learning and brainstorming led by Code for Atlanta. The day opens with an introduction to civic tech as a national and global movement. Then, attendees will participate in a beginner-level workshop on web development. Lunch will consist of roundtable conversations on local civic issues. Following that will be a workshop on building a neighborhood website. To close Civic Spark Day, attendees will gather together for a collective brainstorm on potential civic projects.</p>
    <p>Code for Atlanta organizer <a href="https://twitter.com/fwallacephd">Dr. Faith Wallace</a> has designed the workshop curriculum and will lead instruction. Teaching assistants will be available to help attendees during the workshops.</p>

    <h3>Apply to Attend</h3>
    <p>Civic Spark Day is for <strong>true novices to coding</strong>: people who've never coded before but want to learn. The workshops will focus on website development: HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. We particularly invite members of Atlanta's civic and social innovation community to attend.</p>
    <p>Space is limited to 20 attendees, so we ask that you fill out an application for admission. Admission is free.</p>
